# 10 Days JavaScript Challenge - HackerRank

Welcome to my repository for the **HackerRank 10 Days JavaScript Challenge**! ðŸŽ¯

## About the Challenge

This challenge is designed to help strengthen JavaScript programming fundamentals over a period of 10 days. Each day, I'll work on coding problems that focus on core JavaScript concepts such as variables, loops, functions, and more.

## Goals
- Improve understanding of basic and intermediate JavaScript concepts.
- Practice problem-solving through coding exercises.
- Share my progress and solutions with others.

## Structure

Each day has its own folder containing:
- Problem descriptions.
- My solutions to the challenges in JavaScript.

## How to Run the Code

To run any of the solutions locally, ensure you have **Node.js** installed on your machine. 

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Skclouds/HackerRank-JS-Challenge.git

  2. Navigate to the specific day's folder:
     cd Day-x

  3.Run the solution with Node.js
    node file-name.js
